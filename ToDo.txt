[=== CODE ===]
* Finish 65c02:
  - add new addresing mode for 65c02 (BBR/BBS)
  - implement BBR/BBS
  - implement _BBR/BBS

* Fully implement WORD support:
  - add multiplication:
    - parsing
    - SNF
    - SIF

* Finish POINTERS:
  - what is left?

* New feauture: INLINE (what do we need here as steps?)
* New feauture: VAR parameters in procedure
* New feauture: word registers like RegisterAX/AY/XY/XA/YA/YX (parameters only)
* New feauture: 24bit registers like RegisterAXY/AYX (parameters only)
* New feauture: Integers
* New feauture: Float/Real
* New feauture: Labels

[=== IDE ===]
* Code editing:
  - [Ctrl]+[Shift]+Up: jump to declaration or implementation of procedure
  - smart Find: when you hit Ctrl+F, to grab the word the carret is on

* Debugger:
  - remove RAM map and put Stack
  - Variable panel: make it better :)
    - Showing all CPU registers, including SP
    - Option to choose what to show: Registers, Variables,...
    - manual adding RAM addresses
  - Placing break points in the editor.

* Generated code panel:
  - better visualization of multibyte variables (maybe 8 ro 16 per row)

[=== INTERNALS ===]
* Constant propagation? so code like "a + 10 + 20 + 30" will generate: a + 60
